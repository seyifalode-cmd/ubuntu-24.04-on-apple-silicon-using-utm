### 🧩 **Step 5 – Install GUI and Guest Tools (for Better Performance)**

After successfully installing Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, it’s time to set up a **desktop environment (GUI)** and **guest tools** to enhance your virtualization experience.  
These steps make Ubuntu smoother to use — improving graphics, clipboard sharing, file transfer, and window resizing.

#### 🖥️ Install GUI (Ubuntu Desktop Environment)
Run the following commands inside your Ubuntu terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tasksel
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop

### **⚙️ Step 6 – Install Guest Tools (SPICE Integration) (Optional)** 

To further improve performance and system stability, you can install optional utilities or performance monitoring tools.

```bash
sudo apt install htop
sudo apt install neofetch
